## Intentions / Goal

Heavily inspired from the work of [Proxmox VE Helper Scripts](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/), I would like to create a modified version which is able to run locally and deploy LXC and VM containers to homelab components within a local network.

## Usage

```sh
# bring up interactive menu of choices
moxy 
# 
```
