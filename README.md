> _Please always be cautious and thoroughly evaluate scripts and automation tasks obtained from external sources._

## Functional Goals

- These scripts allow for the creation of a Linux container or virtual machine in an interactive manner, with options for both basic and advanced configurations.
- The basic setup uses default settings, while the advanced setup offers the possibility to modify the settings.
- The options are presented in a dialog box format using the **whiptail** command and the script collects and validates the user's input to generate the final configuration of the container or virtual machine.

## Usage

- **Network Download** - all scripts can be deployed to a Proxmox console by going to the [website](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/), choosing a script, and then copying the one-line script to the console:

    ![example site script](./docs/example-site-script.png)

- **Git Clone** - by cloning this repo into a directory on a Proxmox server you have access to the same script choices via the popular [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner:

    ```sh
    # list all available scripts and ENV vars
    just
    # example: run PVE post install script
    just pve-post-install
    ```

    > **Note:** your Proxmox server will _not_ have `just` installed by default but you can install it with `apt install just`
